We are broadly focused on understanding how large populations of neurons coordinate to efficiently and robustly process information and how this processing is shaped by learning and adaptation. We primarily address these questions by developing <strong>normative</strong> theories of neural computation and testing these theories on data. For an overview the normative approach, I recommend this excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP3znbxmyRg">tutorial</a> by Anne Hermunstad. <br><br>
Two driving questions in our lab are:
<ul>
  <li>What are the objectives that describe how neural populations represent 
  sensory inputs?</li>
  <li>How are these population objectives optimized by collections of neurons
  that learn and adapt exclusively using local signals?</li>
</ul>
Some of our recent efforts are described below.

<h3>Learning and synaptic plasticity</h3>

<p>
A primary mechanism for learning in the brain is synaptic plasticity. However, the relationship between changes at the synaptic level and associated changes at the neural population level remains poorly understood. We develop normative frameworks that relate population level learning objectives and synaptic plasticity rules, with an emphasis on non-Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity. For an overview this work, see our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXLife.1.013008">review article</a> and these <a href="/slides/njit.pdf">slides</a>.

<h3>Adaptive coding efficiency and the role of interneurons</h3>

<p>
Early sensory systems are thought to efficiently encode information from natural signals using minimal resources. Since environments are constantly in flux, this necessitates sensory systems that can rapidly adapt to changing sensory statistics. There is extensive experimental and theoretical 
work devoted to understanding adaptation at the single neuron level; however, much less is known about the mechanisms that support adaptation at the neural population level. We develop normative circuit models for understanding how adaptation mechanisms such as gain modulation and synaptic plasticity support efficient coding of sensory information in neural populations. For an overview of this work, see these <a href="/slides/utaustin.pdf">slides</a>.

<h3>Representational similarity metrics</h3>

<p>
A challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning is to understand if two neural systems process information similarly. In biological and artificial neural networks, information is represented in high-dimensional neural state space. We develop methods for quantifying the similarity between these neural representations.
