<p>
We are broadly focused on understanding how large populations of neurons 
coordinate to robustly process information. Two driving questions are:
<ul>
  <li> What are the objectives that describe neural population activities?</li>
  <li> How are these population objectives optimized by collections of neurons
  that learn and adapt using local signals?</li>
</ul>
We address these questions by developing <strong>normative</strong> theories and 
testing these theories on data.
Some of our recent efforts are listed below.
</p>

<h3>Learning and synaptic plasticity</h3>

<p>
  A primary mechanism for learning in the brain is synaptic plasticity. 
  However, the relationship between changes at the synaptic level and associated 
  changes at the neural population level remains poorly understood. 
  We develop normative mathematical frameworks that relate population level 
  learning objectives and synaptic plasticity rules.

<h3>Adaptive coding efficiency</h3>

<p>
  Early sensory systems are thought to efficiently encode information from 
  natural signals using minimal resources. Since environments are constantly 
  in flux, this necessitates sensory systems that can rapidly adapt to 
  changing sensory statistics. There is extensive experimental and theoretical 
  work devoted to understanding adaptation at the single neuron level; however, 
  much less is known about the mechanisms that support adaptation at the neural 
  population level. We develop normative circuit models for understanding how adaptation 
  mechanisms such as gain modulation and synaptic plasticity support efficient 
  coding of sensory information in neural populations.

<h3>Representational similarity metrics</h3>

<p>
  A challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning is to 
  understand if two neural systems process information similarly. In biological 
  and artificial neural networks, information is represented in high-dimensional 
  neural state space. We develop methods for quantifying the similarity between 
  these neural representations.
