<h1>How do neural populations collectively process information?</h1>

<p>
  <br>
  We are a theoretical neuroscience and machine learning lab broadly 
  interested in how populations of biological or artificial neurons 
  represent the environment, and how learning and adaptation  
  shape these representations. <br><br>
  Our lab is opening in the Department of Neuroscience at Baylor College 
  of Medicine in January 2025.
